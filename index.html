    <p> Thanks for checking out my page! Since your here, let me tell you a bit about myself. First, my name is Melanie Rivas, I am 30 years old, born and raised in New Jersey. I am married to my sweetheart of 10 years, his name is Lewis. We have two amazing kids, a daughter named London and a son Nolan. Both kids, fill our lives with so much happiness and laughter. Lets just say, theres never a quiet moment at the Rivas’s residence. We moved to the great city of Houston 5 years ago. Houston has now become home for my family and myself. It has offered so much opportunities and experiences to learn from. I was laid off from my job back in November. I was not sure what my next step was going to be. I didn’t feel I was fulfilled in my professional environment. There’s not much creativity in Human Resources. I know I wanted more than just a job to just pay bills and support my family, I wanted a career to show my talent, challenge me and a career my children would be impressed by. That is why I’m so grateful that I came across Digital Crafts, I didn’t know much about webpage development. But I worked with so many computer programs throughout my 12 years of administration, I grew more curious as to “how these programs work” and now the rest in history. 	I’m enrolled in as a full time student at Digital Crafts. I looked forward to developing my skills and making this my dream career!
        As if being a mother, wife and student isn’t enough I am a full time volunteer at a local elementary school and translator. Check out my other interests below.
